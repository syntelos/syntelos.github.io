      <p> The fundamental logical object is the mathematical
	type <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XNKDHWhxO1RulN-frS5QON2UjKkFrxDjDPM-Xwy4uNI/edit?usp=drive_link">[MATH/20190618]</a> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PrfnLpdRxz6ZR_cG-Tse7dnQoawX_fHV_gUTeDZv4wE/edit?usp=drive_link">[MATH/20190625]</a>.
      </p>

      <p> The framed type opens the application domain of
	symbolic logic from the mathematical abstraction of
	physical objectivity to include a logical treatment
	of metaphysical objectivity.
      </p>

      <p> Therefore the framed type is abstracted to the
	logical object.
      </p>

    </div>

    <div class="chapter" xml:id="theory">
      <h2><a label="theory">Theory</a></h2>

      <p> The physical objectivity has been formalized to
	the scientific method of phenomenology.
      </p>

      <p> In physical objectivity, a physical frame is an
	established (scientific) context of reproducible evidence.
	Of course, the spacetime (inertial) frame of reference is
	the ultimate, most abstract, or common physical context of
	recognition.  There is no logical space in the physical
	objective beyond the spacetime reference frame.
      </p>

      <p> The quantum mechanical reference frame may appear
	to be far removed from the objects and relationships
	of the spacetime reference frame, but it remains a
	logical member of the spacetime reference frame.
      </p>

      <p> As in the case of the spacetime reference frame,
	the state of an observable is recognized relative to
	the reference frame.  The resulting object of
	observation is a state in a frame.  The state has no
	utility without the frame.
      </p>

      <p> Likewise throughout logic.  A logical object has a
	type definition.  A boolean object is one of two
	values.  The definition of the type employs elements
	of a context of interpretation, the logical frame of
	reference.
      </p>

      <p> Our objective is not typically abstract. Our
	objective is typically the sentient aperture onto
	phenomena of experience.  The experiential
	observation is metaphysical.  It is the observation
	which is metaphysical.
      </p>

      <p> In logical
	existentialism <a href="/lexist">[LEX]</a>, a
	metaphysical frame is defined with a complex system
	of consciousness having static, dynamic, and
	temporal states of being, an experio-temporal
	manifold, and a micro-metaphysical musculature.  The
	principal system model represents the component
	membership of the state of being.
      </p>

      <blockquote>

	  </mrow>
	</math>
      </blockquote>
	
      <p> The complex system of consciousness experiences
	somatic, spiritual, intellectual, social, physical,
	sexual, and esoteric states of being.  These
	psycho-physiological states of being occur as a
	coloring of experience that influences observation
	and behavior.
      </p>

      <p> In order to characterize an observable we must be
	able to reference the types of its properties.
	These are found in the context of interpretation or
	frame of reference.
      </p>

      <p> A metaphysical frame of reference is founded upon
	the states of being as principal
	psycho-physiological observables.  A frame of
	reference is founded upon a logical abstraction
	developed by the recognition, objectification,
	conception, and validation of the logical objects of
	the phenomena of experience.
      </p>

      <p> The conception of the spacetime reference frame
	may be credited to Albert Einstein for convenience,
	while the origin of the spacetime reference frame
	remains metaphysical.  However, this property of the
	spacetime reference frame is not relevant to its
	abstract extent in logic.  Likewise, we are unable
	to deny the metaphysical extent of that context of
	recognition.
      </p>

      <br class="sink"/>

      <p> A logical object is an enumeration of properties.
	Each property is the instance of a type.  Each type
	is the specification of possible value.  The
	instance of a type is a well defined value.
      </p>

      <p> A value object is a resolved type expression by
	which an element of a possibility space is selected.
      </p>

      <p> A value object is a logical object.
      </p>

      <p> When a logical object is a type object, one or
	more logical objects is a frame of reference.
      </p>

      <p> An object of observation is framed by a type
	object.  When the object of observation represents a
	possibility space, it is a type object.  Likewise,
	the derivatives of a type object are framed objects
	of observation.
      </p>

      <p> This structure is epistemological objectivity.  It
	accepts the fact of sentient phenomenology, and
	rejects the denial of phenomena beyond the vagueries
	of arbitrary logical hegemony.
      </p>

      <p> The statement establishes relativistic
	metaphysics.  The object of observation is
	relatively metaphysical to a relatively physical
	observable.  A physical observation, the product of
	a mechanical instrument, is relatively metaphysical
	as the object of observation.  Likewise, the
	sentient experience of observation (e.g. sight) is
	relatively metaphysical.
      </p>

      <p> In both cases we have an observation which
	requires qualification.  The epistemology of
	objective qualification is a metaphysical
	epistemology.  The establishment, framing, and
	objectification of the qualification of observation
	is distinct from the establishment, framing, and
	objectification of an observable.  With a
	metaphysical discipline of epistemology, the
	sentient sensory instrument is qualified to coexist
	with the mechanical instrument, terminating the
	crisis of physical logical positivism.  We resolve
	the distinction of observable to dispel the problem
	of objective.
      </p>

      <p> Positivistic metaphysics shares objective
	actuality with a larger phenomenological space than
	the logically physical objective.  The phenomena of
	experience demand an epistemological establishment,
	which is afforded by a metaphysical distinction.
      </p>

    <div class="chapter" xml:id="syntax">
      <h2><a label="syntax">Syntax</a></h2>

      <p> The type object is the most abstract concept
	available to theory.  A mature theory accommodates
	frames of reference as well as abstract, continuous,
	and discrete observables.  The common abstraction is
	not exclusive of any relevant concept.
      </p>

      <p> A first practical example might be words in
	natural language: e.g. English.  These abstract
	objects are frames that are oriented to context,
	associated to meaning, and attached to chains of
	expression to communicate the sharing of
	understanding.  Each expression attempts to employ
	and apply these frames.  Each reception attempts to
	recognize the employment and application in order to
	discern a projected intent of understanding.
      </p>

      <p> Unlike simpler terms, the atoms of natural
	language readily elicit the generic character of the
	logical atom as a frame.  The imagination is
	captured by the observation of abstraction available
	to the history of learning, and the early childhood
	achievement of the acquisition of language.  The
	review of the intellectual inventory is most
	familiar closest to home.
      </p>

      <p> Like an abstract symbolic term, the unbound
	natural atom has an open space of possible
	projections.  The association of representation is
	available to be mapped onto attributes, properties,
	qualities, values, or semantics.  This (associative)
	aspect of the syntactic terminal is an alternative
	characterization which reveals the latent inherent
	frame of the type object.
      </p>

      <br class="sink"/>
      
      <p> The cognitive frame required may be introduced by
	the distinction of objectification as the
	recognition and association of objects from
	hyper-objectification as the manipulative or
	exploitative association of objects of recognition
	to indulgences of inanity.  Within the cognitive
	frame we experience the aspects of objects in
	appearance, sense, reflection, and annihilation.
      </p>

      <p> The experiential aspect of object is proximal to
	the refinement of semantic association available
	from the generic, unemployed and unapplied, frame
	that is each word.  The process of developing
	understanding from communication is an application
	of those frames to some intended employment.  To the
	employment of intent.
      </p>

      <br class="sink"/>      

      <p> It is from the metaphysical frame that we
	prescribe a logical or physical frame.  The logical
	frame asserts an abstraction that excludes the
	psycho-physiological universes of variance from
	objects of recognition, assertion, or conjecture.
	The physical frame attempts to maintain the logical
	abstraction over the observation and measurement of
	reproducible physical phenomena (e.g. inertia,
	gravity, radiation), and reproducible physical
	observations (e.g. astronomy).
      </p>

      <p> The establishment asserts an escape from
	ourselves, while remaining entirely sensible to the
	neuro-physiological origin.  The logical abstraction
	challenges subjectivity with the positivistic
	rejection.  The integrity of comprehension is
	presumed to be common, familiar, and integral.  A
	seemingly extraordinary requirement.  Generations of
	training in the relatively authoritarian,
	supremacist, scientism of prestige or
	reproducibility represents only a marginal general
	advancement due to receptivity to the advancement of
	positivism.  Epistemological formality is assured by
	contextual awareness and explicit comprehension.
	The logical frame is a critical formality.  It is
	prepared to capture, maintain, and handle variations
	of context, association, and semantics.  Rather than
	contextual presumptions, contextual formality opens
	subjects of relation and issues of tangency.
      </p>

      <p> To mathematics the import promises a capacity for
	complexity analogous to that of object oriented
	programming in software systems.  Far larger and
	more expansive in power, but a similar idea.
	Likewise throughout logic, physics, and metaphysics.
      </p>

      <p> Semantic independence is objective to natural
	(contextual) language, but has long been anathema to
	artificial (context free) language.  The occasions
	of semantic uniqueness in Physics are supported by
	the formalization of framing.  They are exceedingly
	rare, but their elucidation is served by
	transparency and may be handled or supported by
	frame concepts.  Semantic isolation supports the
	observation and analysis of semantic detail and
	complexity.
      </p>

      <p> Associations of property, attribute, sense, or
	quality benefit from framing.  Opening, exploring
	and developing complexity is requisite to
	comprehension.  Only relatively trivial endeavors
	may be held in mind, while reading or working.
	Myriad universes of complexity beckon understanding
	to develop comprehension.  In order to do so, we
	will decompose, identify, and characterize or wonder
	and ponder.

    <div class="chapter" xml:id="determinism">
      <h2><a label="determinism">Determinism</a></h2>

      <p> Logical determinism is the benefit of certainty in the
	analysis of data and hypothesis relating to past, present, or
	future.  The wealth of knowledge, physical and metaphysical,
	reproducible and irreproducible.  The statistical certainty is
	probabilistic confidence.  The deterministic certainty lies
	crisply on a figure of merit.  A conception inclusive of
	physical and metaphysical domains of application.
      </p>

      <p> Logical determinism is founded upon objectivity rationalized
	to categorical identities associated to common and universal
	observables of reflection or projection.  The philological
	invariants of experience and learning.  Of practical
	experience or theoretical abstraction.  Of measure or
	hypothesis.  Of data or test.
      </p>

    </div>
 
    <div class="chapter" xml:id="existence">
      <h2><a label="existence">Existence</a></h2>

      <p> The independence of computation and type may be
	obscure, historically.  The freedom of logical
	determinism is assured by the conservation of
	dimension found in type and representation.  Each of
	object and dimension orthogonal in domain and range
	related independently.
      </p>

      <p> The relationship of type and representation most
	familiar to computing and most significant to logic
	and mathematics.  The permanence of conception,
	abstraction, and relation.
      </p>

      <p> The conservation of comprehension in contextuality
	is demonstrated for reproducible phenomena in the
	fields of physics.  An appreciation of logical
	determinism must comprehend complexity and
	phenomenology.  Subjectivity and objectivity framed
	such that the breadth and depth of phenomenology be
	circumscribed in practice and abstraction such that
	errors of measure and theory include conception as
	well as comprehension.
      </p>

      <p> The conservation of comprehension is facilitated
	by the conception of dimension, and the recognition
	of contextuality as available to conception as frame
	integral to type.  The independence essential to
	freedom, and thereby logical determinism, realized.
	The properties, attributes, qualities, and
	relationships of context have abstraction,
	conception, and representation by frame.
      </p>

      <p> The subjugation of objective to objects of
	reflection in measurement and projection in theory
	occurs in worlds upon worlds of context in self,
	individual, community, society, and world that
	inform and shape language and expression as well as
	forms and functions of invention as subjects of the
	crown.  The situation and condition of history since
	antiquity is common and familiar to the solar
	systems of monarchies and empires found among the
	esoterica of imagination.  The distractions and
	deflections of conveniences known and unknown.  As
	common and familiar as rain.  Sources of uncertainty
	that entertain the physical entropy we bear witness
	to environmentally.  As our own fidelity to self and
	same is none other than the medievalism that
	struggles with the conception and confidence of law.

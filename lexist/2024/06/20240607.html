      <p> The ontological freedom of being represents the
	natural agencies of body and mind abstract from
	individual and society.  The object of conservation
	in the teleological fidelity of being.
      </p>

      <p> The logic familiar to physics and mathematics as
	the conservation of instrumentality, and the
	conservation of dimension.  The conservation of
	logical determinism is analogous to the conservation
	of self determination.
      </p>

      <p> In politics the object of freedom is typically
	subjugated to the object of exploitation.  A logical
	infidelity represented by the betrayal of self,
	other, and children.
      </p>

      <p> A base situation convenienced by subjective
	disease.  The common and familiar egomania that
	would conflate independence and isolation in the
	merry-go-round of false equivalence facilitated by
	the perpetual campaigns of distraction, deflection,
	dissembly, and deception that camouflage the
	narcissism, avarice, and sadism of nihilistic
	infantilism.
      </p>

      <br/>

      <p> The disease of darkness lives in mystery.  The
	distractions of focus, interest, and concern that
	give time to inanity seem to validate insanity.
      </p>

      <p> The ontological freedom of humanity contrasts to
	the teleological infidelities to the freedom of
	humanity.  The selflessness of humanity necessary
	and essential to cooperation the metaphysics of
	society.  The selfishness of carelessness and
	violence the metaphysics of anti-society.  Their
	measure in economics.  Their management in law.
	Their sovereignty in politics.
      </p>

      <p> Practical existence circumscribed in the small of
	individual as in the large of nation by selflessness
	and selfishness, humanity and inhumanity.
      </p>

      <p> Selflessness is the metaphysics of society as
	person, industry, and government.  The composition
	of being and society necessary and essential to the
	arithmetic of economics.  Its occlusion to obscurity
	the concern of liability and risk.  And a loss of
	reason.
      </p>

      <p> The interior within the somnial mind of individual
	is self referential.  The inner consciousness is
	selfish in naivety, or selfless in awareness.  The
	outer consciousness of sense and reason is
	introverted in a micro-cosmological existence of
	social isolation, or extroverted in a
	macro-cosmological existence of social membership.
	The structure of being.
      </p>

      <p> A gyroscope of existence.  Some are able to rotate
	the outer being from the introversion to the
	extroversion, given the insight to existential
	consciousness.  Social awareness.  The practical
	economic viability of selflessness.  Proletarian
	security.
      </p>

      <p> The freedom of egalitarianism is a common fact of
	existence.  From being to society, we share in
	awareness and perish in ignorance.  The benefit of
	inclusion in contrast to the tyranny of exclusion.
	While we are communicating, we have a practical and
	practicable humanity.
      </p>

      <br/>

      <p> Natural law is existential materialism.  The
	conservation of the gift of life endowed by our
	parents in biological physics and existential
	metaphysics.  As individual member of society, or
	behavioral enigma.  The epistemological web of
	existence in the natural domain of <i>homo sapien in
	vitro</i>, and the supernatural domain of
	selflessness, language, and communication.
      </p>

      <p> The ontological materialism of being is framed in
	objective consciousness, and unframed in subjective
	consciousness.  The presence found in the exercises
	of the career of being in the courage of autonomy.
	The mindlessness of carelessness.  The fragility of
	vulnerability an ethereal vitality denied in
	selfishness and exercised in selflessness.  The
	career of being in the seas and oceans of emotion
	and population.  Humanity opposed by inhumanity.
	Adultism opposed by infantilism.  Subsistence,
	sustenance, and continuity in conflict with crime.
	The exercise of being in the courage of autonomy and
	the cowardice of heteronomy.
      </p>

      <p> Formal law constructs government by establishment
	to conduct the peace and dignity of humanity in the
	voices of autonomy.  To adjudicate the moral right
	to autonomy in conflict with the deprivation and
	depredation of heteronomous crime.  To maintain the
	social mutuality borne of cooperation.  To sustain
	the social mutuality borne of language.  To
	structure our mutuality, first collective security.
      </p>

      <p> Lines of conception which occasion the violences
	of heteronomy.  The objects of our collective wealth
	attractive to the desperations of the insensible and
	incapable instrumentality.  In the large as in the
	small.
      </p>

      <p> The emancipation of humanity from inanity the
	generational project of the human era.  The arc of
	history which bends toward justice is conservative
	of the perspective, language, voice, and
	communication necessary and essential to humanity.
	From the subjugation of the medievalism of
	heteronomy, to the modernity of autonomy, the defeat
	of the plague of confusion by awareness.
      </p>

      <p> The conception of corporal morality as
	representative of self preservation, and social
	morality as the freedom of egalitarianism and the
	security of proletarianism.  The distinction of
	power as mutuality from crime.  The recognition of
	materialism as substance and significance in origin
	of relationship with biological physics and
	metaphysics.
      </p>

      <p> The metaphysical laws of existence generally
	analogous to the formal laws of social government.
	The power of conception.  The criminalization of
	violence.
      </p>

    </div>

    <div class="chapter" xml:id="introduction">
      <h2><a label="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

      <p> The framing of existence to the benefit of
	language and communication meets the demands of
	logic at dimensional freedom.  The contradiction of
	entropy by logical determinism is metaphysical.  A
	rarely recognized concept unfamiliar to the public
	commons.  We fail to conceive of government.  We
	fail to maintain sovereignty.  A recognition of
	planetary significance evinced by climate change and
	its anthropomorphic causality.
      </p>

      <p> Experience is first subjective.  Knowing is first
	existential.  The somnial mind of our nascence,
	common and familiar, the metaphysical universe.  The
	objective ideal, purposeful, and often imperfect is
	typically flawed by economic compromise, a peculiar
	convenience.  Our infidelities to freedom regularly
	excused by the acculturated dogma of egomania.
      </p>

      <p> The integrity of dimensional freedom is the
	universal objective of abstraction, conception,
	derivation, and application.  Logical conservatism
	as the teleological fidelity to ontological freedom.
	The natural domain of existence superseded by the
	supernatural domain of language to reveal humanity
	as the metaphysical freedom of logical
	determinism.
      </p>

      <p> The freedom of conception and communication
	necessary and essential to humanity is only poorly
	and infrequently recognized and maintained.  The
	betrayal of self, other, and children on behalf of
	senselessness, carelessness, recklessness, and
	violence is the common and familiar source of
	entropy.  The processes of metaphysical determinism
	subverted by impatience and ignorance, often
	characterized as short sighted or self destructive.
      </p>
      
      <p> The physical power of mutuality in egalitarianism
	and proletarianism contradicted and opposed by the
	criminal power of manipulation fails to conceive of
	the mutuality of government and law as social.  The
	misogynistic materialism of anti-social capitalism
	the perpetual infantile tragedy of inhumanity.
      </p>

      <p> The failure of the sovereignty of humanity as
	equivalent to physical entropy the plain evidence
	occasionally held in universal recognition.
      </p>

      <br/>

      <p> Issues of metaphysics and being have been common
	mysteries of humanity responsible for the
	deprivations and depredations of wellbeing and
	welfare manifest by political crime.
      </p>

      <p> The confidence of selflessness necessary and
	essential to wellbeing and welfare in partnership
	and society is plagued by the experience of
	deprivation and depredation on behalf of political
	crime.  The pathological supremacism of selfishness
	evident in the mysogynistic materialism of
	anti-social capitalism.
      </p>

      <p> The selflessness of awareness in conflict with the
	selfishness of naivety.  The awareness of
	selflessness necessary and essential to the
	cooperative power of industry and government.  The
	metaphysics of economic arithmetic.  The self
	referential interior within the somnial mind
	habituated to selflessness in social awareness, or
	alienated to it by the annihilations of metaphysical
	cannibalism.
      </p>

      <p> This recognition of humanity as selfless, war as
	criminal, love as trust, and inanity as insane, is
	comprehensive of more than has been demonstrated in
	the epoch of human history.  The actuality of
	medievalism the inhibition of the sovereignty of
	humanity.  Existential crisis the terror of the
	tyranny of micro-cosmological introversion.  While
	we are warring in crisis, we inhabit the practical
	inhumanity of combatism and violence.  Subjugated to
	the darkness of ignorance.
      </p>

	consciousness.  That experience is colored by the
	state of being found among manifest components of
	consciousness.  That subjectivity is colored by the
	state of being, including corporal

	(<math><mi>&beta;</mi></math>), social

      <p> Abstractly, the coloring of experience within

      <p> Concluding, psychological cosmology has

	</blockquote>
      </p><!-- (chrome font bug hack) --><p> The
	micro-cosmological state of being
	(<math><mi>&alpha;</mi></math>) and the
	macro-cosmological state of being
	(<math><mi>&omega;</mi></math>) in the general
	relationship of psychology to society.
      </p>

      <p> Elementary subjective universalization subsumes
	the physical objective familiar to science to
	contain the humanity of history in past, present,
	and future.  As comprehensive of the natural domain
	of <i>homo sapien in vitro</i>, and the supernatural
	domain of human being in language and society.
      </p>

      <p> The anthropological framing of metaphysical
	existence (<math><mi>&epsilon;</mi></math>) becomes
	tedious at the objective resolution of logical
	conservatism.  In Physics, we typically discard the
	subjective frame to focus on the objective frame,
	exclusively.  However, in Philosophy of Science we
	reaquire the anthropological frame to (at least)
	reexamine our assumptions.
      </p>

      <br/>

      <p> The selflessness essential and necessary to the
	social mutuality of egalitarian freedom and
	proletarian security is evident as individual and
	social instrumentality.  The teleological fidelity
	to ontological freedom in the preservation,
	conservation, and development of humanity envelops
	the diversity of requirements and objectives on
	behalf of individual and society.
	<blockquote>

      </p><!-- --><p> The formation of government
	(<math><mi>&Gamma;</mi></math>) from society
	(<math><mi>&gamma;</mi></math>) as solving problems
	in the mutuality of focus, interest, and concern.
	Principally, ordering dimensions of collective
	security.  Government formalizes the public commons
	in voice, establishes the conservation of the
	ontological freedom of communication as teleological
	fidelity to humanity.
      </p>

      <p> In the teleological fidelity to the ontological
	freedom of humanity, government is formal law.  The
	maintenance and development of the ontological
	freedom of humanity.  However, the history of formal
	law has the categorical recognition of class
	government.  From the abstractions of literature to
	the practice of society.  Of judges and kings,
	theocracy and democracy.

    <div class="chapter" xml:id="freedom">
      <h2><a label="freedom">Freedom</a></h2>

      <p> The frames of logical type theory are logically
	conservative as teleological fidelity is
	conservative of ontological dimension.
      </p>

      <p> Each word a frame.  The objects of conception,
	application, and employment are symbolic types as
	abstractions intermediary to conception,
	application, and employment.  The purpose a
	categorical classification.
      </p>

      <p> The conservation of logical determinism is
	effected by the teleological completeness of a
	logical system.  The integrity of teleological
	fidelity to ontological freedom.
      </p>

      <p> The abstraction of ontological freedom from
	teleological conception is found by the resolution
	of logical determinism.  The ontological dimensions
	of interest relate conception to purpose by freedom.
	As communication is the freedom of publishing or
	internetworking.
      </p>

      <p> The conservation of ontological freedom would

      <p> Analogously, a logical system might be recognized
	in the form and function of any product.  And its
	efficacy.
      </p>

      <p> The abstract frame of determinism envelops concept
	in the detail of product.  The frames of conception
	and production may be the symbolic objects of a
	logical system, or the paragraphs, sentences, and
	words of an essay.  This recognition of the objects
	of communication and interaction manifests the
	humanity of existence in the supernatural domain,
	and the logical relationships of metaphysical
	existence.
      </p>

      <br/>

      <p> Individualism as the confidence of selflessness in
	society and partnership is a reflection of the
	ontological freedom of being.
      </p>

      <p> Socialism as the subjugation of inhumanity to the
	sovereignty of humanity in the freedom of
	egalitarianism and the security of proletarianism is
	a reflection of the ontological freedom of being.
	The contradiction of the anti-social on behalf of
	selflessness as socially conservative.  Its
	perception and acculturation.
      </p>

      <p> A contradiction of the history of the nihilistic
	abuse of the public commons.  Of our habituation to
	the metaphysical cannibalism of self annihilation.
      </p>

      <p> With framing we distinguish substance and
	significance from the narcissitic abuse of
	communication.  The manipulation of sanity on behalf
	of infantilism ranges over unremarkable, remarkable,
	unbelievable, unimaginable, and incomprehensible.
	The self destruction of the annihilation parasitism
	is virtually inexplicable.  Its identification
	critical and vital to the wellbeing and welfare of
	both individual and society.  The identification of
	distraction, deflection, dissembly, and deception
	essential to cognizance.  The identification of
	debasement, degradation, defamation, deprivation,
	depredation, and destruction essential to
	sustenance.  The desperate dependence of the
	infantilism consumed by fear and self loathing,
	found perpetrating the social destruction of
	personal camouflage.  The perpetual predation of
	social and corporal awareness on behalf of the
	invisibility of the infantilism.  Examples large and
	small are plentiful and common.  And explain the
	retardation of humanity evident in anthropomorphic
	climate change, and virtually every dimension of
	existence.
      </p>

      <p> With framing the self destruction of the
	annihilation parasitism becomes apparent, and
	ideally common.  That inanity embarasses insanity is
	a reversal of object from projection of emotion to
	reflection of fact.  A tragically common feature of
	culture.  A miscomprehension of the humor of
	ridicule that we teach our children.  A loss of
	conception that impacts virtually every dimension of

      <p> The freedom of humanity in confrontation with
	inhumanity has equivalence to the metaphysical
	contest of humanity with entropy.  The logical
	determinism embraced economically in the confidence
	of certainty is partial to humanity's contest with
	entropy.  The class of physical determinism that
	informs the machinery of industry is related to
	humanity as tool, and thereby only indirectly
	related to the metaphysical contest of humanity with
	entropy.
      </p>

      <p> The indeterminism of inhumanity is evinced by

      <p> Analogously, the objective betrayed by the

      <p> The similarities of political and social conflict
	represents equivalence.  The problem in the small of
	the experience of the public commons is fairly
	identical to the problem in the large of the public

      <p> It should be obvious that it is fear that
	motivates them.  The invisible of violence.  Who
	attack the brave in projecting the inferiority of
	the autophobia that beguiles them.  And that war
	reflects the very same phenomenon.  The sociological
	beguilements of narcissism and sadism in government
	and politics.  My own experience of the infantilism
	of the inferior and the superior of our number
	confirms it.  The social intrigues seemingly
	obviated by the concourse of uncertainty and
	contest.
      </p>

      <p> In the existential physicalism, conception lies
	not in positivistic pragmatism, but sociological
	pragmatism.  The ocean of perspectives and
	objectives possibly an admixture of partial
	derivatives in science and culture.  The objects of
	philology swimming with the languages of currency.
	The audience of reception as large as possible.
	Ideas of recognition alloyed by their readers, and
	distracted by their detractors.  As conducts its
	course into order and disorder, success and failure.
      </p>

      <p> Peace and violence are the psychological products
	of states seemingly environmental.  The sociological
	currency of peace and violence is cultural and
	perceptual as the conduct of nations.  The focus,
	interest, and concern amalgamated from a self
	interest fixated upon immediate society.
      </p>

      <p> The crown affair my slippery slope.  As the mind
	might marshal the sense, spirit, and body to the
	recognition of being and existence, despite the
	begging and crying of infantile nihilism.  The
	distractions that afflict us with violence and war.
	As the wind might marshal the sense of spirit and
	mind to the distractions and deceptions of
	narcissism and sadism.  Those prostitutions begging
	poverty, destitution, and destruction.  The vanity
	of arrogance in the psychological projections of
	moral insanity.
      </p>

      <p> Opening awareness and conception to metaphysical
	materialism as the cosmological space of cultural
	actuality.  Closing awareness to infantile nihilism
	as the fatalistic wasting of reality.

      <p> In the open vistas of plein air, the relationships
	of bodies and minds shifts out of the investments
	and wisdom of crisis and conflict.  A natural
	distance from satisfied.  That peace and dignity are
	common objects.  That physics and metaphysics are
	known to subsistence, sustenance, and continuity.
	That survival became subsistence.  And from
	subsistence became sustenance.  By awareness in
	humanity, continuity.  A process of enlightenment by
	culture, politics, and government in society and
	communication.  A process of actualization and
	realization in person, family, community, and
	nation.  A cultural inertia of awareness broadening
	to the inclusion of experience among the
	philological objects of expression and language.
	Ourselves unified, rather than divided to the
	convenience of narcissistic hysteria.  Our lives
	valued in conservatism, rather than debased and
	denigrated in nihilism.
      </p>

      <p> A breathable air.  A drinkable water.  An
	effective economy.  A substantial technology.  An
	existential materialism.  Having biological and
	sociological relevance.  Rather than blinded by
	narcissism and sadism.  Distracted and deceived by
	nihilism.  Lost in the green woods of lust.
      </p>

      <p> While night and day rain justice, man and woman,
	light and dark, escape the crisis and conflict of
	insouciance.  The physical and metaphysical
	cannibalism of psychological inhibition,
	carelessness, and recklessness remain lit by the
	awareness of society as population.  The
	sociopathological darkness of sociological ignorance
	bears the weight of reactionism in the collective
	awareness of illiberalism.
      </p>

      <p> The magic gold of dawn and dusk conserved to their
	respective investments.  The metaphysics of
	technological economy communicating in philological,
	ideological, and ontological substance of
	significance and relevance.  Conservative of
	individual and population as able and willing to
	participate in human society.
      </p>

      <p> Our becoming by awareness.  The conception of
	being and existence in the objects of person and
	society framed by biology, psychology,
	intellectuality, and sociology.  The simplicity of
	states in being and person framed in the society of
	others as membership and relationship.  The
	complexity of process in experience and learning
	inclusive of those sociological distinctions of
	behavior and expression.  A philological security
	and insecurity.  A known history, and an uncertain
	future.  The frustum of perspective.  The structure
	of our intercourse.  The prevalence of confusion,
	uncertainty, and doubt that scatters our forces,
	dissolves our investments, and squanders our time.
	To senselessness, carelessness, and recklessness
	rather than the sense and wisdom of experience and
	learning recognized by conception.  The completeness
	of teleological fidelity to ontological freedom.
      </p>

      <p> Into the light of the integrity of our mutual
	conservation of the investments of time accumulated
	by learning from careers of experience benefit us in
	past, present, and future.  The rational society,
	uninhibited by the losses to moral insanity, by the
	conception of it.  The independence of sympathy and
	morality by intellectuality and integrity.  The
	exercise of the journey is biological,
	psychological, intellectual, and sociological.  The
	mysteries of experience are anthropological.  The
	physics and metaphysics of existence, knowable.  As
	the curiosities of learning concede to the wisdom of
	experience in the fortitude of witness and the
	integrity of justice.
      </p>

      <p> The dimensions of existential being in the
	processes of the concourse of our intercourse are
	biological, psychological, intellectual, and
	sociological, and variously invested in physicality
	and metaphysicality, security and insecurity, by
	situation and circumstance, education, training, and
	experience and learning.  The dignity of humanity
	found or lost among the vagaries of context and
	culture.
      </p>

      <p> Our social discourse suffers it.  A nihilistic
	culture is sensible to a reasonable appreciation of
	actuality.  Departures from narcissistic convenience
	are the extraordinary rarities of genius.  The
	professions too often lackadaisical and
	anachronistic.  The vocations relatively dependent.
	Moral integrity in a process of rediscovery.
      </p>

      <p> The relationship of body, mind, society, and
	environment.  The moral and immoral universes of
	sanity and insanity.  Physical and metaphysical.
	Microcosmæ of fear, nihilism, and macrocosmæ of
	humanism.  The power of conception.  Existence in
	veracity or deception, actuality or ignorance,
	investment or crime.  The dimensions of biology,
	psychology, intellectuality, and sociology invested
	by entropy are moderated by work and exacerbated by
	carelessness.
      </p>

      <p> Originating in the social experience of terror and
	joy.  The sociological person <i>in vitro</i> by the
	interpretation of experience wanders between
	behavior and expression.  Those who behave socially,
	and the socially reckless.  Those in awareness of
	others, and those lost in existence.  The wandering
	of souls among the dependents and the independents
	in the obscurity of a cultural ocean of familiarity.
	Monkies and men.  Some parasitic. Draining the moral
	resevoir of awareness by the brutality of a banality
	that is suggestive of convenience.
      </p>

      <p> The gray zone of experience from which one might
	learn of work and crime.  Humanism and nihilism.
	Fear and pride.  Life and death.  The concourse of
	our intercourse remarkable for the moral dichotomy
	of philological existence.  Of <i>anima</i>
	and <i>animus</i>.  The elevation of humanity, and
	the depravity of nihilism.  The able and unable
	differentiated morally in an anthropology of
	individual self preservation, and social mutual
	conservation, by the benefit of intellect in health
	and illness.  Subjective disease as the depravity of
	the psychological inhibition to a moral abstraction.
      </p>

    </div>
    
    <div class="chapter" xml:id="three">
      <h2><a label="three">three</a></h2>

      <p> The <i>animus</i> in nature survives from birth
	till death in dependence upon environment, and the
	exploitations of its opportunities.
	The <i>anima</i> in society is elevated by language
	and technology above the environment.  An organic
	biological dichotomy of anthropology found in
	morality as substance of mortal significance and
	relevance.  The socially able individual compares to
	a socially disabled individual in a temporal
	abstraction over natural history, or more
	practically (<i>in vitro</i>) in a subjective state
	of being as psychological and intellectual.
      </p>

      <p> A popular sovereignty uninformed of subjective
	mortality has been accomodating and indulging of
	infantilism as the psychological state
	of <i>animus</i> in modernity.  An error of the
	signifiance of the moral failure causal to violence,
	conflict, and war.  And an error of particular
	significance in the present moment as the United
	States circles the drain of constitutional failure.
	The generational failure of moral fatigue.
      </p>

      <p> The contest of certainty and uncertainty, security
	and insecurity, morality and criminality, that light
	and dark, that cultural metaphor of a modernity
	defined by the physical and metaphysical freedom of
	ontological philology, formal law, and technological
	economy.  The actuality of the sociological person
	conflicted by the opacity of the mysteries of
	psychological inhibition.  By the dependence of
	psychological inhibition upon biological,
	psychological, intellectual, and sociological
	autonomy.  The imposition of psychological
	inhibition upon biological, psychological,
	intellectual, and sociological autonomy the obvious
	crime.
      </p>

      <p> The light of moral integrity leads us unto the
	sustenance of the wandering soul.  From the
	discoveries of the mysteries of existence, to the
	revelations of the existential invariants of
	biology, psychology, intellectuality, and sociology
	that sustain us in the integrity of the conception
	of moral autonomy.  The distractions of imposition
	by empathy the objects of experience that would
	conflate moral autonomy with social conservatism.
      </p>

      <p> The demands of biology and sociology upon
	psychology and intellectuality are universal.  The
	challenges to autonomy and voice familiar to gender
	and color are universal.  They are the impositions
	of psychological inhibition upon psychological
	autonomy.  The projection of inferiority upon
	superiority as begging and crying might break the
	silence of peace and dignity.  As our humanity
	confronts our inhumanity.  As the inanity of moral
	insanity begs moral sanity by the substance of
	significance and relevance.  In the meaning of
	words.  The cause of humanity.
      </p>

      <p> The perpetual conflict of the recklessness of
	infantilism.  Nihilism <i>versus</i> humanism.  The
	metaphysical entropy of noise challenging signal in
	the information of our communication.  The physical
	entropy of violence challenging peace in the
	economics of our communication.  The concourse of
	our intercourse challenged by the distraction,
	deflection, dissembly, deception, denial,
	deprivation, and depredation of narcissism and
	sadism.
      </p>

      <p> An experience of confusion, illusion, and delusion
	sensible as the psychic pain of an uncertain
	contextual realism is universal.  While the social
	conduct of the sense of others to our behavior and
	expression is a bridge too far for the infantile
	condition of the psychologically inhibited.  The
	cause of the empathic inhibitions of wisdom derived
	from the learning of the experience of the actuality
	of nihilism.  The classification of the
	pathologically inane as morally insane a practical
	necessity of a pragmatic conduct.  The metaphysical
	wealth of a wisdom derived from the experience of
	the self annihilation by self gratification common
	to infantilism and nihilism.
      </p>

      <p> The meaning of words informed of a reasonable
	appreciation of actuality is morally conservative of
	self, person, the society of others, and the worlds
	of life and environment.  As a matter of mortal
	necessity.  And as a matter of the human continuity
	of life in sustenance.  The human partnership by
	intimacy, familiarity, and society.  By the physical
	and metaphysical communication of conduct and
	expression.
      </p>

      <p> Our generosity and greed variously beautiful and
	ugly at the distances required of a reasonable sense
	of appreciation.  As Earthrise from Moon.  The
	objects of focus, interest, and concern remote from
	corporal and psychological vulnerability.  A
	question of sympathy, not empathy.  The literal
	sympathy of humanity.  And the figurative sympathy
	of nihilism.  A membership or objectification of
	society.  In <i>anima</i> or <i>animus</i> as
	relatively human.  Perceptible.  Recognizable.  As
	subject to identification and characterization.
      </p>

      <p> The exercise of the journey a learning experience
	forming the wisdom to discern a reasonable
	appreciation of actuality, and a reasonable sense of
	justice as psychological, criminological, and
	sociological.  The biological, psychological,
	intellectual, and sociological dimensions of
	existence and the conduct of our intercourse bearing
	the weight of humanity.  The meaning of words.  The
	state of being.  The anthropological integrity of
	morality and communication as our metaphysical
	wealth.  The subjective mortality of our past,
	present, and future.
      </p>

      <p> The heteronomy of psychology and philology
	apparent to the diversity of experience and thought,
	recognition and reflection, as the capabilities and
	facilities of faculty.  Voice distinct from noise.
	The varied discourse of our conduct and its
	structure by natural and formal law the critical
	material of a political relevance.  The sovereignty
	of our elevation above the environment.  The
	integrity of our morality.

      <p> We cannot deal with what we do not know.  The
	mysticism of existence that obscures the processes
	of life, birth and death, from awareness inhibits
	the wisdom of experience.  Nihilism.  The obscurity
	that would camouflage and normalize narcissism and
	sadism is a disservice to the human potential.  The
	projection of psychological inhibition onto society
	is an accident of history.  
      </p>

      <p> The nihilistic culture that accomodates and
	indulges infantilism embraces pareidolia as the
	entertainment of deception, identity as the
	exploitation of psychology, and isolation as the
	independence of society.  Elements of ignorance
	contributing to the psychological atrophy and
	morbidity of subjective disease.  Tolerated in the
	good faith of the harmony of good will.  The moral
	failure of subjective mortality.
      </p>

      <p> Better to identify and characterize the phenomena
	of existence in the humanity of a moral universe.
	Better to discuss the experience and to develop the
	learning in the spirit of mutual conservatism, than
	to strangle the future by the hand of ignorance and
	irresponsibility.  In the shadow of psychological
	inhibition, carelessness, and recklessness that are
	convenienced by it.  In that darkness that darkens
	the dark.  By moral detachment and disengagement.
      </p>

      <p> The exercise of life's journey is moral as the
	psychological establishment, maintenance, and
	development of self, person, and society.  An
	exercise of humanity as the distinction of behavior
	and expression in society by the awareness of others
	in a morally interdependent partnership of social
	conservatism.  The exercise of expression.  The
	communication of understanding.  As ideological or
	ontological.  By teleological fidelity to purpose
	and intent.
      </p>

      <p> The assignation of meaning a philological endeavor
	invested by expression and reception.  In the
	confidence of rational society.  In the faith of a
	moral universe.  Unimpeded, uninterrupted, and
	unmolested by the incessant begging and crying of
	infantile nihilism that would seem to influence
	culture and, thereby, philosophy.  The monotony of
	purpose and intent between expression and reception
	evidence of the moral integrity of humanity
	seemingly demanded by the incessant narcissistic
	begging familiar to nihilistic culture.  The shadow
	of a desperation and greed owed to the psychological
	inhibition of autophobia that is pathologically
	inane and inextant.  The loss of humanity to nihilism
	a common crime.
      </p>

      <p> The integrity of morality a philological endeavor
	invested by language, culture, and the conduct of
	the social intercourse.  The subjective mortality of
	the existential immortality of humanity found in the
	hands of its learned disciples.  The vestments of
	positivistic epistemology inured to ontology as the
	necessary truth of existential invariance found in
	the practice of the philological and philosophical
	disciplines.  The light of moral integrity that
	crowns us sacred before eternity.  The soul of
	humanity.
      </p>

      <p> That communication bears reflection.  That society
	is rational.  The hallmarks of sanity.  The
	conservation of the physical and metaphysical
	institutions of our perpetual investments.  The
	divinity of humanity in the conquest of morality and
	economics.  The evolution of humanity by awareness.
      </p>

      <p> The opening of εγώ to the recognition, conception,
	and identification of the emotional and temporal
	distinctions of the somnial being as existential,
	experiential, psychological, intellectual, and
	sociological plants the seeds of further advancement
	in the establishment, maintenance, and development
	of humanism.  The emotional experience of the
	somnial being extracted or retrieved from a Jungian
	conception of the “third eye” as an occasional
	somnial conscious being, to the actualization and
	realization of existential being as anthropological,
	biological, psychological, intellectual, and
	sociological.  An existential immortality in the
	depth and breadth of the comprehension of the
	sociological individual <i>via</i> animate humanism
	as component agency to a moral universe of
	metaphysical wealth.  That the moral sanity of the
	population demands welfare and wellbeing.  That
	society is rational.  That communication is
	worthwhile.  That humanity is perpetual.  That a
	positivistic, ontological, anthropological
	objectivity promises an invariant, immutable, and
	necessary veracity.

      <p> When we conceive of the special powers of
	government as the special legal immunities of its
	offices to perform its lawfully established
	agencies, we avoid the moral ambiguities we might
	herald with the example of the British Monarchy.
	The mine fields of moral hazards failed that might
	seem to obscure those very failures.  The
	habituation to moral failure that seems to herald
	the moral hazard.  While not as glaringly obvious as
	the case of Russia in Ukraine, or Israel in
	Palestine, or China in Tibet, the case of the
	British Monarchy would model a fairly common moral
	obscurity.
      </p>

      <p> As is confusing in the public commons.  As might
	conflate the perception of human or civil rights, or
	that of law generally, with the practical derogation
	of sociological conservatism.  As of individual
	physical and metaphysical autonomy.  As in the
	sociological conservation of physical and
	metaphysical investments, generally.
      </p>

      <p> The conception of moral abstraction established,
	maintained, and developed, or scattered and
	squandered to the wind and rain of the character or
	nature of any psychological habituation.  To the
	nihilistic self annihilation, in particular, as the
	elevation of physical and metaphysical entropy.
      </p>

      <p> The wisdom of experience, or the debasement of
	self annihilation, the existential mortality of
	human society in perpetuity.  As illustrated by the
	situation of the United States, at the present
	moment, circling the drain of constitutional failure
	by the moral derogation of law in the narcissistic
	conveniencing of psychological inhibition by the
	criminal capitulation to the behavioral defamation,
	denigration, deprivation, and depredation of others
	as the nihilistic social supremacism that would
	camouflage and normalize the actuality of the social
	inferiority of psychological inhibition,
	intellectual immorality, and sociological
	nihilism.
      </p>

      <p> The existential immortality of the power of
	conception made plain in this sociology of
	anthropological morality.  The crime of nihilism.
      </p>

      <p> The absurdity of self annihilation engendered by
	example revealing of the substance, significance,
	and relevance of the nihilistic culture that would
	accomodate and indulge narcissistic infantilism.
	The confusion of illusion and delusion that fails to
	maintain the teleological mortality of the
	sociological determinism of population arithmetic in
	our extant physical and metaphysical dimensions.  As
	in William Golding's novel, “Lord of the Flies”
	(1954).  Or, Pierre Boulle's novel, “La Planète des
	singes” (1963).  As ridiculous as it is
	inexplicable.  The capitulation to criminality
	revealing of the moral insanity of psychological
	inhibition by self annihilation.

      <p> When we conceive of spirituality, we might venture
	a philosophical journey into humanity and nihilism.
	As a millennial cultural Satanism has developed to a
	centennial cultural Nihilism, we stand in witness to
	an evolution of our common philological objects in
	the relative eternity of human divinity.  The
	spiritual frameworks of Christianty and Buddhism, in
	particular, recommend peace and dignity in a
	spiritual isolation from subjective disease.
	Analogously, Biology and Psychology recommend
	scientific objectivity in the confrontations of
	phenomenology.  As the completeness of teleological
	fidelity to ontological freedom.
      </p>

      <p> In our common experience, we bear languages of
	emotional familiarity through an existential
	contextualization of the psychological phenomena of
	subjective disease.  And as well, we bear languages
	of spirituality through a sociological
	contextualization of cultural phenomena.  Perhaps
	“sin”.  Perhaps “crime”.  Perform representation
	adequate to the contextualization of a moral
	universe.
      </p>

      <p> By the distance of caution, care, and concern we
	transform our lives from that burden of language
	that invests the sights of being with “the horrors
	of the whores”, to a human objective sentience of
	awareness.  As a pathological “subjective disease”.
	As a salutological “moral insanity”.  Exiting the
	nihilistic contextualization of psychological
	manipulation, and entering the humanistic
	contextualization of the moral existence of human
	society.  And, thereby, defeat the acculturated
	nihilistic supremacism of the chaos of emotional
	discord that conveniences the self annihilation of
	self gratification of self deception original to the
	inferiority of psychological inhibition.
      </p>

      <p> An intellectual habituation constructive of the
	spiritual cosmology prerequisite to healthy
	psychological development.  The education and
	training of psychological strategy informative of
	the intellectual actualization and realization that
	transforms εγώ from an existential past to an
	emotional present in preparation for a human
	interaction.
      </p>

      <p> The individualistic journey from mutual
	annihilation to mutual conservatism that would
	obviate or discard the criminological anti-social
	behavioral complex in favor of the rational human
	sociality of ζωή.  
      </p>

      <p> The acculturated expression of familiarity is a
	latent burden of language known by emotionality.
	The familiarity employed to secure hysteria becomes
	an identity complex at the collusion of mutual
	annihilation.  That is, unwinding the identity
	complex from its implicit relationships virtually
	intangible.  Alternatively, acculturating humanism
	as spiritual isolationism and social conservatism is
	capable of the establishment, maintenance, and
	development of the healthy intellect prerequisite to
	a healthy spirit.
      </p>

      <p> The εγώ in existential experience is fundamentally
	representative of the intellectual practice of
	habituation.  As language informs culture.  As
	speech informs behavior.  Intellect molds and shapes
	the individual emotional experience of εγώ.  The
	existential being in the history of experience is
	εγώ.  As habituated to sadistic supremacism,
	narcissistic convenience, or human autonomy.  This
	being is the product of an experience formed by an
	intellectual practice and habituation.  
      </p>

      <p> Subjective health is elected by purpose or
	accident to the concourse of existence.  For the
	individual as εγώ, and by presence, to society as
	ζωή.  A participatory membership benefits from the
	human interaction trained by the habituation to the
	patience that informs intellect by actualization,
	and benefits being by realization.

      <p> The intimacies of presence, partipation, and

      <p> A synchronicity of actualization and realization
	in sociological awareness is expansive over the
	universal inclusion of ζωή.  According to character
	in the wisdom of experience known to spirituality
	and objectivity.  That hummanity is accepted.  That
	nihilism is rejected.  Without familiarity.  With
	the objectivity demanded of society in solution to
	the extant requirements of biology, psychology,
	intellectuality, and sociology.
      </p>

      <p> The performances of humanity, and demonstrations
	of nihilism, independent by awareness.  Available to
	recognition by conception and communication.  As
	demonstrated daily in the aristographic and
	kakographic media of Culture, Politics, and
	Journalism as extant fields of vocation, profession,
	and practice.  As we bear witness to the moral
	universe of humanity in the processes of
	actualization and realization that transform the
	future into the present, and the present into the
	past.  We work as we walk.
      </p>

      <p> We talk as we walk.  “We can walk and chew gum at
	the same time”.  Referring to the intellectual
	recognition and conception of subjective disease,
	and the practice of the rejection of nihilistic
	influences prerequisite to the metaphysical wealth
	of wellbeing for individual and society.
      </p>

      <p> The exercise of the journey in processes of
	actualization and realization is common to the human
	domain of <i>anima</i> psychology.  As the cultural
	exercise of the psychological gymnasium of the
	philological diversity of experience to
	contextualization, recognition, objectification, and
	abstraction.  The relatively practical exercise of
	the contextualization and abstraction of
	understanding and comprehension.  The human
	birthright.
      </p>

      <p> The metaphysical wealth of generations.  Available
	to experience at an interaction yesterday, today,
	and tomorrow.  According to the prioritization of
	humanism over nihilism.

      <p> A sense of history is a sense of humanity.  The
	instrument tuned to the anthropological framing of
	biology, psychology, intellectuality, and sociology
	is reasonably sensible to the information of
	understanding available to communication.  The
	bandwidth of public media demonstrative of
	aristographic and kakistographic presentations.
      </p>

      <p> This anthropological humanism peering into the
	lense of history might benefit from a conception of
	θεολογία, λογοτεχνία, and κοινά as abstract
	representatives of theology, literature, and
	poltics.  The anthropological θεολογία, λογοτεχνία,
	and κοινά as the abstract elements of the human
	concourse in past, present, and future.  The
	products of local and remote perspectives on a
	relevant intercourse are occasionally reasonable or
	unreasonable, as fiction or nonfiction.  Relatively
	entertaining of narcissism, or attempting
	of a rational objectivity.
      </p>

      <p> In the anthropological abstraction, it is easy to
	maintain that war is the criminal product of
	sociological vagaries of narcissism and sadism.  It
	is easy to maintain the moral universe prerequisite
	to humanism.  Regardless of the objective or
	subjective context.  And, thereby, to render a
	perceived subjective microcosm of rational
	comprehension as moral or immoral.
      </p>

      <p> The objective subjective dualism the constant
	companion of λογοτεχνία.  The teleological fidelity
	to ontological material freedom of origin demanding
	of effort and instrumentality.  The positivistic
	discipline assuring of logical determinism.
      </p>

      <p> An anthropological θεολογία entirely human.  The
	formality of conduct evident in the formal Church of
	Saint Peter, independent of the objective
	actualization.
      </p>

      <p> And likewise an anthropological κοινά as might
	render Middle Europe to a political history of the
	Holy Roman Empire as the evolutionary bridge of
	humanity from relative violence to relative peace.
	As, today, Modern Europe rediscovers peace.  In the
	metaphysical wealth of nations.  In the metaphysical
	wealth of that justice which promises humanity.

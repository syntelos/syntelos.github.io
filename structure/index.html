      <p> It's hard to make sense of, from nonlinear evidence 
          and expression.  There's a high and a low to everything, 
          it would appear, but the moral reference frame of these objects
          in their contexts and perspectives isn't often convenient to 
          habitude.
      </p>
      
      <p> Our elevation above the natural environment is a feature
          of a metaphysical evolution in language and society.  The 
          society of communication supports us, individual and 
          collective.  A fact of existence.  Our greatest strength.  So, it's 
          natural that our reinforcement occurs in language, in 
          communication, in the philosophical establishment of 
          humanity.
      </p>
      
      <p> The beauty of humanity.  The expression of existence.  
          With eyes to see.  The journey we walk.
      </p>

      <p> The structure of society assured by politics and 
          government is an abstract feature of existence.  Far more
          abstract is the history of thought that assures the structure
          of politics and government.  The structure of humanity as the
          public good of a moral peace.  The structure of conception.
      </p>

      <p> As we conceive of law or person, we win or lose the peace.
          It is the structure of conception that rationalizes biology and
          sociology to physical power, and identifies criminal power in its
          relationship to the causality of war, to win the peace and assure
          prosperity.
      </p>

      <p> The perception of philosophy as valuable on the scale of
          economic material significance is available from teleological 
          fidelity to ontological freedom, from gnosiological completeness, 
          from a metaphysical comprehension of moral determinism.  By the
          illumination of value.  By the recognition of value.  
      </p>

      <p> The structure of society represented by economic value is 
          conservative of humanity.  Our political demands for safety and 
          security, structured as a moral peace, find satisfaction and 
          prosperity in the continuity of humanity.  
      </p>

      <p> The power of society is the biological population and the
          sociological coordination as cooperstion, collaboration, and 
          communication.  The practical structure of government has
          an abstract or theoretical or logical structure in thought.  The 
          power of conception.  The idea that captures the handles and 
          boundaries of utility and performance.  The abtsract metaphysical
          power of society in thought, philology, and philosophy.
      </p>
      
      <p> The construction of philosophy in anthropology and morality 
          to assure the continuity of humanity has assured us peace and 
          prosperity, in the moment and in our potential future.  
      </p>
      
      <p> We live in a ponderous moment of contradictions balanced 
          in awareness, assured by the sociological determinism of 
          population.  Rather than suspended in a sociological
          nondeterminism.  The success of the effort to actualize
          philosophically and to realize sociologically.
      </p> 
      
      <p> The perception of value in the effort to conceive and normalize
          humanity in the philosophical moment benefits from the
          recognition of alternative outcomes for nation and globe,
          or from the recognition of advancement and normalization of
          humanity in peace and prosperity.  A decade in global processes of
          actualization and realization benefitting from advancement by
          framing and conception.
      </p>
      
      <p> Making sense of a moment in which values are often or 
          occasionally inverted from the human normal to an unrecognizable 
          abnormal is tedious.  Ideally we approach depth of value in the
          performance of the unwinding of insanity to sanity by framing.
          The conservation of wealth as metaphysical in the perseverence 
          of actualization, and the sociological relevance of realization.
      </p>
      
      <p> The horizons of experience sorted to a rational society has
          been critical to the sense of peace and dignity that we enjoy, 
          today.  The continuity of humanity that recognizes the 
          metaphysical necessity of cooperation, collaboration, and 
          communication to society.  The power of society.  Is the rational
          zenith.  And the contradiction of the nadir.
      </p>
      
      <p> Knowing that the hysteria of moral insanity is avoidable is a 
          special blessing.  The enablement and empowerment of moral 
          sanity in the conservation of metaphysical wealth.  The dissuasion 
          of malfeasance, malevolence, crime, and war by the necessities of 
          existence.  Provable humanity.  Shown by the structure of society as
          dependent upon the humanity of the anthropological morality of 
          self preservation and mutual conservation.
      </p>
      
      <p> The security of a rational society is the product of the integrity 
          of humanity.  The integrity of conception from biological identity
          to sociological membership.  A gnosiological capacity for
          conceptual integrity that offers profound psychological and 
          intellectual security.  The power of conception within self and same
          is the empowerment of humanity.  The fortitude of profound 
          confidence in person and society.  By person and people.  Our 
          foundation in the fundamentals of existence.
      </p>
      
      <p> As we elevate practical life into awareness, we balance the 
          somnial mind.  The mind in service of a moral soul of being.
          The substance of being becomes sustainable and perpetual
          lightness of being in self and same.
      </p>
      
      <p> Our value to each other becomes matterial.  Society has
          gained substance of significance.  And we have developed our
          power.

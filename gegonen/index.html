      <h2><a label="object">Introduction</a></h2>

      <p> When we accept the metaphysical subjectivity of a
	comprehensive positivism, we arrive at the demand
	for self conception possessed of degrees of
	comprehension.  We arrive at consciousness as
	instaneous, and consciousness as somnial
	existentialism.  We arrive at morality as corporal
	in self preservation and social conservation.  And,
	we arrive at the recognition of our social actuality
	as possessed of confusion, illusion, and delusion.
	The reality of animalism and humanism as the
	philological hysteria and rationality of
	senselessness in contradistinction with patience.
	The self indulgence of self gratification in
	contradiction to nature in an aberrant childhood of
	dependence upon a misplaced and misappropriated
	education.  The inverted morality of insanity.  And
	its camouflage and normalization.
      </p>

      <p> A burden foisted upon the socio-cultural
	minorities as occasion the moral impositions of
	confusion, illusion, and delusion.  First, women.
	Bearers of education by necessities of coexistence
	and demands of society.  Bearers of the crying of
	impatience and begging for attention that evolve
	from the proper childhood of nascence to the
	improper childhood of infantilism.
      </p>

      <p> That government like village has evolved through
	the issues of population and person in the tedium of
	the narcissistic compromises with infantile
	camouflage and normalization is a recognition of
	society and gender, sexuality and reproduction,
	critical to an actualization of feminism as social
	and corporal.
      </p>

    </div>

    <div class="chapter" xml:id="actualization">
      <h2><a label="theory">Actualization</a></h2>

      <p> Our confrontation with actuality begins with the
	common and universal experience of inhumanity.  As
	experienced by women with the sardonic humor of
	irony at the display of the irrational situated in
	the pretentious conceit of sanity that violates
	humanity and abuses consciousness.  As experienced
	by men with an animalism adopted in childhood such
	that dogs bear a degree of wisdom by the
	demonstration of awareness, and their sons bear a
	degree of wisdom by the demonstration of
	interdependence.
      </p>

      <p> A formula for coexistence such that philological
	rationality is subjugated to hysterical
	senselessness.  Our familiarity with the
	normalization of infantilism, well known as
	ignorance.  And, the cultural mysticism at the
	center of the subject of the ontological freedom of
	humanity.  The logical autonomy of body and mind,
	thought and communication.
      </p>

      <p> A perspective that unifies a conception of
	feminism as a woman's campaign for awareness,
	humanity, and solidarity with a conception of
	humanity as philological and (therefore)
	philosophical.  That feminism illuminates humanism.
	That feminism should prove the nature and character
	of existence in the cultural milieu of confusion,
	illusion, and delusion so familiar to us, today.
      </p>

    <div class="chapter" xml:id="realization">
      <h2><a label="theory">Realization</a></h2>

      <p> The individual independent of the moral heteronomy
	of social hysteria experiences the self as an
	existential soul of being.  The emotional products
	of life and living in a sense of the heart as the
	somnial center.  Love as the existential
	relationship of body to other and society found in
	that corporal center of being in a somnial awareness
	of self.  Morality as self preservation and social
	conservation in that self awareness.
      </p>

      <p> This person has realized the relationship of body
	and mind in environment and society, in the
	perpetual patience to actualize experience to
	learning, and realize learning to expression.
      </p>

      <p> In the gender distinction of reproduction, one
	recognizes other as same.  The lesson of
	kindergarten.  "I'm not the only one.".  Developed
	in the social context as relevant to politics and
	government, business and industry.
      </p>

      <p> The socio-economic dimensions of existence obey
	the laws of numerical order as the wealth of
	knowledge in the ontological invariants of
	experience.  The philosophical advantage of our
	humanity over our inhumanity.
      </p>

    </div>

    <div class="chapter" xml:id="reflection">
      <h2><a label="theory">Reflection</a></h2>

      <p> Behavioralism would represent the substance of
	violence in the significance of experience.  The
	products of moral insanity.  The hysteria that begs
	reproduction.  The insanity that begs culture.  The
	normalization of social and asocial egomania in
	plain evidence throughout experience, both public
	and common.
      </p>

      <p> The dimensions of physics and metaphysics have
	merit worthy of note, the foundations of society in
	the wealth of knowledge, but are unaccomodated by,
	and unavailable from, the inanity of insanity.  The
	poverty of insanity, divorced from the
	instrumentality of metaphysical humanity necessary
	to individual person and social intercourse.
      </p>

      <p> The normalization of hysteria, egomania, and
	insanity as representative of subjective disease as
	psychological carelessness and recklessness is
	evident in that violation of nature which inverts
	individual and social metaphysical wealth from the
	acceptance of the currency of objective and
	pragmatic reason (positivism) to the acceptance of
	the currencies of the selfish obsessions of moral
	insanity (infantilism).  An abuse of a social
	generosity of membership at the inclusion of its
	philological adepts to the inversion of values from
	instrumentality to brutality.  That negation of
	existence represented by nihilism.
      </p>

      <p> Any annihilation of sense and reason for the
	benefit of illbeing and poverty is criminal, as the
	social formalization of the physics and metaphysics
	of individual and society.  The law of nature.
      </p>

      <p> The violation of the law of nature is ridiculous.
	Its proponents beyond pathetic.  The merit of
	substance and significance seemingly obviated by a
	behavioral normalization of moral insanity.
      </p>

    </div>

    <div class="chapter" xml:id="projection">
      <h2><a label="theory">Projection</a></h2>

      <p> The destruction of society stands in evidence, at
	the moment, as an effect of moral insanity.  Our
	public media is repleat with the case study
	materials: primary, secondary, and tertiary.
	Criminal, discursive, and cultural.
      </p>

      <p> It should be obvious.  However, it is not commonly
	well understood that society is not permanent and
	impregnable to our manipulation.  The dystopic
	childhood well known to literature and its
	presentations.  The materialization of iconography
	in the self indulgence of self gratification
	demanded by an atheistic supremacism.  The ignoble
	philology of inanity that would camouflage
	infantilism normalized to a social acceptance that
	annihilated the common sense and reason of natural
	law.
      </p>

      <p> Humanity as population and society is vulnerable.
	It is neither more than, nor other than.  It is
	physically biological, and metaphysically
	existential.  The cowardice that subtends existence
	to some perpetual other than, to some perpetual more
	than, fails to differentiate those illusions of
	delusion that satisfy the gratification of self
	deception necessary to sustaining an habituation to
	rationalization by hysteria and realization by
	confusion.
      </p>

      <p> The begging and crying that perverts society to
	something other than itself obscures the actuality
	of humanity.  As sexuality may be obscure to
	humanity.  As the meaning of words may be obscure to
	humanity.  And, as the values of conservatism may be
	obscure to humanity.
      </p>

      <p> The increasingly ridiculous and absurd
	demonstrations of moral insanity at the breadth and
	depth of our physical and metaphysical wealth become
	available to experience as learning when moral
	sanity as self preservation and social conservation
	is demonstrated.  A basic educational standard of
	positivistic ontology as foundational to civil
	society.  A conception of law as the social
	formalization of the physical and metaphysical
	character of nature.  And, a conception of language
	as philological and philosophical.
      </p>

      <p> The differentiation of positivistic ontology from
	nihilistic ideology identified, characterized,
	illustrated, and illuminated such that the
	annihilation of sense and reason provoked by the
	inanity and illusion of profound psychological
	carelessness and recklessness might become available
	to recognition, reflection, actualization, and
	realization.  The inversion of metaphysical
	annihilation.  A conception of the metaphysical
	paradox of hysteria that is causal to the demands of
	the camouflage and normalization of moral insanity.
	The paradoxical mass destruction by mass deception
	predicted by George Orwell in "1984".
      </p>

    <div class="chapter" xml:id="teleology">
      <h2><a label="theory">Teleology</a></h2>

      <p> The pantheon of humanity at the principal
	reproductive relationships presents us with a
	critical lesson of existence.  The lesson of family.
	The structure of human existence in the temporaneity
	of reproduction is illuminating of spirituality,
	intellectuality, sociality, physicality, and
	sexuality.  As the original psychological gymnasium
	heralded by the Book of Genesis almost four
	millennia ago, a mirror reflecting upon experience
	and learning, sexuality and asexuality, sociality
	and asociality, wisdom and foolishness, intimacy and
	violence, right and wrong, morality and insanity.
	The values of conservatism.
      </p>

      <p> The formalization of physical existence to
	metaphysical existence applies <b>teleological
	positivism</b> to ontological actuality in the
	conservation of the logical autonomy of ontological
	invariance for the development of the metaphysical
	wealth of our knowledge of logical determinism to
	manifest the physical wealth of individual and
	society.
      </p>

      <p> The development of experience and learning to the
	metaphysical wealth of knowledge occurs in the
	identification and characterization of physical
	value by recognition and abstraction.
      </p>

      <p> The conservation of metaphysical wealth in the
	derivation of physical wealth is demanding of
	physical and metaphysical instrumentality.  The
	comprehension of experience and learning for the
	application of logical determinism to the
	reproduction of expertise.

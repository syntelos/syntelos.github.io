      <h2><a label="object">Introduction</a></h2>

      <p> When we accept the metaphysical subjectivity of a
	comprehensive positivism, we arrive at the demand for self
	conception possessed of degrees of comprehension.  We arrive
	at consciousness as instaneous, and consciousness as somnial
	existenantialism.  We arrive at morality as corporal in self
	preservation and social conservation.  And, we arrive at the
	recognition of our social actuality as possessed of confusion,
	illusion, and delusion.  The reality of animalism and humanism
	as the philological hysteria and rationality of senselessness
	in contradistinction with patience.  The self indulgence of
	self gratification in contradiction to nature in an aberrant
	childhood of dependence upon a misplaced and misappropriated
	education.  The inverted morality of insanity.  And its
	camouflage and normalization.
      </p>

      <p> A burden foisted upon the socio-cultural minorities as
	occasion the moral impositions of confusion, illusion, and
	delusion.  First, women.  Bearers of education by necessities
	of coexistence and demands of society.  Bearers of the crying
	of impatience and begging for attention that evolve from the
	proper childhood of nascence to the improper childhood of
	infantilism.
      </p>

      <p> That government like village has evolved through the issues
	of population and person in the tedium of the narcissistic
	compromises with infantile camouflage and normalization is a
	recognition of society and gender, sexuality and reproduction,
	critical to an actualization of feminism as social and
	corporal.
      </p>

    <div class="chapter" xml:id="actualization">
      <h2><a label="theory">Actualization</a></h2>

      <p> Our confrontation with actuality begins with the common and
	universal experience of inhumanity.  As experienced by women
	with the sardonic humor of irony at the display of the
	irrational situated in the pretentious conceit of sanity that
	violates humanity and abuses consciousness.  As experienced by
	men with an animalism adopted in childhood such that dogs bear
	a degree of wisdom by the demonstration of awareness, and
	their sons bear a degree of wisdom by the demonstration of
	interdependence.
      </p>

      <p> A formula for coexistence such that philological rationality
	is subjugated to hysterical senselessness.  Our familiarity
	with the normalization of infantilism, well known as
	ignorance.  And, the cultural mysticism at the center of the
	subject of the ontological freedom of humanity.  The logical
	autonomy of body and mind, thought and communication.
      </p>

      <p> A perspective that unifies a conception of feminism as a
	woman's campaign for awareness, humanity, and solidarity with
	a conception of humanity as philological and (therefore)
	philosophical.  That feminism illuminates humanism.  That
	feminism should prove the nature and character of existence in
	the cultural milieu of confusion, illusion, and delusion so
	familiar to us, today.
      </p>

    <div class="chapter" xml:id="realization">
      <h2><a label="theory">Realization</a></h2>

      <p> The individual independent of the moral heteronomy of social
	hysteria experiences the self as an existential soul of being.
	The emotional products of life and living in a sense of the
	heart as the somnial center.  Love as the existential
	relationship of body to other and society found in that
	corporal center of being in a somnial awareness of self.
	Morality as self preservation and social conservation in that
	self awareness.
      </p>

      <p> This person has realized the relationship of body and mind
	in environment and society, in the perpetual patience to
	actualize experience to learning, and realize learning to
	expression.
      </p>

      <p> In the gender distinction of reproduction, one recognizes
	other as same.  The lesson of kindergarten.  "I'm not the only
	one.".  Developed in the social context as relevant to
	politics and government, business and industry.
      </p>

      <p> The socio-economic dimensions of existence obey
	the laws of numerical order as the wealth of
	knowledge in the ontological invariants of
	experience.  The philosophical advantage of our
	humanity over our inhumanity.
